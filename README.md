# Kmeans-GMMKMeans-implement-by-myself
The ordinary clustering algorithm as well as the Gaussian mixture distribution clustering algorithm implemented through pseudo-code from the watermelon book. The ordinary clustering algorithm is used inside the Gaussian mixture distribution to select the initial mean. Other clustering methods may continue to be updated in the future.

# How to config
You only need to change the path of watermelon dataset. Open config.py and change it.
